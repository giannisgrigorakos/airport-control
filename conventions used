1. See Constants
2. We need a dock_time for each flight in order to free the parking spot as soon as the plane leaves.
This dock_time exists in each gate and is an array of times. So e.g when the current time is 100 (in seconds)
and the departure of a flight is 80 that means that in the 180th second we have a departure so we have to free that spot.
This conditions will be checked every second.
3. In every gate there is a hast tables that maps a flight id with it's estimated departure time ( HashTable < flight_id, departure_time > )
4. To popup window will be implemented with TableView. In order to minimize the popup you have to click to the slightly gray area.
5. Every flight has a certain state (Landing, Holding, Departed, Parked) which is renewed as soon a change happens
6. Two flights cannot have the same flight id!
