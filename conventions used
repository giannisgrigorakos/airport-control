1. See Constants
2. We need a dock_time for each flight in order to free the parking spot as soon as the plane leaves.
This dock_time exists in each gate and is an array of times. So e.g when the current time is 100 (in seconds)
and the departure of a flight is 80 that means that in the 180th second we have a departure so we have to free that spot.
This conditions will be checked every second.
